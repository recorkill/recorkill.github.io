To-do:
- figure out how to center lower row (also see 5, may not be worth doing)
- figure out why upper row images are on top of the sticky menu
- add links to the cards
- add flips to lower row?


--- add CV

To improve on:
- More reusability. Re-writing a lot of the same stuff for different instances, could be a lot better if we created some kind of class to reference instead of re-coding everything.
- Spacing. Spacing. Spacing. Goodness
